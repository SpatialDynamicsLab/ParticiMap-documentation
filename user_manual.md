## How to Explore Maps

The ParticiMap tool facilitates geographic surveys to collect Places by local communities and stakeholders using a Map as the main interface. To explore the Maps created follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Maps section at [https://particimap.cartospot.com/maps/](https://particimap.cartospot.com/maps/).
2. In this section, you will find all available Maps. 
3. Use the sidebar functionality—**Filter by Pilot Community**—to select Maps from "Elfsina," "Balina," or "Milano."
4. Each Map is displayed as a card with information and a button to view the selected Map.

## Mapping a New Place: How Can I Contribute to a Map?

To contribute a new Place to a Map, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired Map.
2. Click the **ADD A PLACE** button.
3. This action will show:
   * A red marker with a '+' sign on the basemap indicating where your new Place will be geolocated.
   * The Map's geosurvey, which contains a set of questions for you to submit data and an image or photo using your mobile phone’s camera. This information will be associated with the Place on the Map.

**When setting the Place geographic position:**

* Zoom in and drag the basemap to set the correct position for the Place.
* The geosurvey will also display an approximate geocoded Address that is automatically generated.
* This address is submitted as a complementary reference to the precise geographic coordinates of the Place.
